|    API     | Quality Docs? | Website       | Sample Query                            |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :------------ | :-------------------------------------- |
| WeatherAPI |      yes      | _example.com_ | _example.com/mickeymouse?s=movies&t=10_ |

<br>

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

```
src
|__ assets/
      |__ data-tests
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
      |__ Hero.jsx
      |__ Ipsum.jsx
      |__ Lorem.jsx
      |__ CTA.jsx
      |__ Footer.jsx
```

<br>

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

<br>

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above. 
>
> Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

<br>

#### Helper Functions

> Use this section to document all helper functionsâ€“ generic functions that can be reused in other applications.

|  Function  | Description                                |
| :--------: | :----------------------------------------- |
| Capitalize | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

<br>

### Post-MVP

> Use this section to document ideas you've had that would be fun (or necessary) for your Post-MVP. This will be helpful when you return to your project after graduation!

- _Add user account and auth capabilities._
- _Utilize the Giphy API to welcome new users with funny gifs._
